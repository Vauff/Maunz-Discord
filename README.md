Maunz is a Discord bot created by Vauff written in Java using the Discord4J library. You can add Maunz to your guild by clicking on the Discord badge above. This project is a Discord port of my [IRC bot Maunz](https://github.com/Vauff/Maunz). If you'd like to suggest features, report bugs, receive assistance on using the bot or just follow development you're free to join the official [Maunz Discord server](https://discord.gg/v55fW9b).
